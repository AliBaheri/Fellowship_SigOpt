 * **Key question**: How we can extend the generic version of Bayesain Optimization if the underlying objective function is a time-varying function or if we are in a spatiotemporal (i.e., dynamic) environment?

## Papers

 * [Bayesian Optimization for Dynamic Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03432.pdf)
 
    * Key idea: The dynamic optimization problem is modeled as a spatiotemporal GP.
 
 * [Real-time control using Bayesian Optimization: A case study in airborne wind energy systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967066117302101)
    * Key idea: Context-dependent Bayesian Optimization is introduced to handle the time-varying nature of the wind shear profile (wind speed vs. altitude).

 ## Applications
 
 * Online portfolio selection
 
 * Sensor set selection
 
 * And in general in any problem whose environment is changing both in sapce and time.
